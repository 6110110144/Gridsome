description: "&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Thai food originated with the people who emigrated from the southern Chinese provinces into modern day Thailand many centuries ago. Historically there were many Szechwan influences in Thai cuisine, although over the centuries many other influences have affected Thai food. In a more distant past, Buddhist monk brought an Indian touch, and southern Muslim states influenced the cooking in the south of Thailand. Much later, Thai food was influenced by European cuisine after contact with Portuguese missionaries and Dutch traders. During these times there were even some influences from the Japanese. Today Thai food is its own, with a special unique blend of the 5 tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and spicy."

But it's not something that is reserved only for new moms—anybody can enjoy it at any time, but new moms are especially encouraged to eat more of it. This is a dish I grew up eating, and my grandmother makes it quite often because my mom loves it. It's also popular amongst the health conscious because it's full of nutritious vegetables!
